High-performance, decentralized blockchain protocol that combines advanced cryptographic techniques, network protocols, and a reputation-based consensus mechanism. It integrates recursive compression, zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs), Libp2p networking, and fixed-size blockchain concepts to offer scalability and security.

This version implements SNARK proof generation with Halo2 and KZG10, timed tokenomics for node reputation, and Gossip Protocol for peer-to-peer communication.
Key Features
1. Fixed-Size Blockchain with Recursive Compression (Compcrypt)

    This Blockchain design uses Compcrypt to recursively compress blockchain data, reducing storage overhead while maintaining the integrity and verifiability of the data.

2. Reputation-Based Consensus

    Instead of traditional Proof of Stake or Proof of Work, a Reputation-Based Consensus mechanism is used where nodes earn timetokens based on their continuous activity.
    Leader election is based on the highest timetokens, with nodes selected via a VRF (Verifiable Random Function).

3. SNARK Proof Generation

    Transaction verification leverages SNARKs with the Halo2 circuit and KZG10 polynomial commitments for privacy-preserving, scalable, and efficient transaction verification.

4. Libp2p and Gossip Protocol

    Libp2p networking library is used for building the P2P communication layer.
    Gossip Protocol ensures peer discovery and block propagation between nodes.

5. Fixed Coin Supply & Tokenomics

    The protocol features fixed supply tokenomics where the total coin supply is capped.
    Transaction fees are distributed equally among validators, and block rewards are provided to consensus participants.

Project Structure

The Prunet repository is organized into multiple components:

    Blockchain Core: Contains logic for blockchain data structures and compression algorithms (using Compcrypt).
    Consensus: Implements the Reputation-Based Consensus mechanism and leader election via timetokens.
    Networking: Manages Libp2p networking and Gossip Protocol for peer-to-peer communication.
    SNARK Proof Generation: Handles transaction validation using Halo2 or KZG10 for zero-knowledge proofs.
    Wallet: A wallet module based on Electrum for generating, signing, and sending transactions.
    Utilities: Helper functions for cryptographic operations and encoding.

Requirements

Before running, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

    C++ Compiler (C++17 or later)
    Rust (for Halo2 integration)
    Libp2p (for networking)
    CMake (for building)
    OpenSSL (for cryptographic operations)
    Snarklib (for SNARK operations)

Installation
Step 1: Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prunet.git
cd

Step 2: Install dependencies

    Libp2p: Follow the instructions on the Libp2p GitHub to install.
    C++ Dependencies: Ensure the following libraries are installed:
        libssl-dev
        libboost-all-dev
        cmake
    Rust Setup: Install Rust if you haven’t already:
        Follow the installation instructions from Rust’s official website.

Step 3: Build the project

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

Step 4: Run the Blockchain

After building the project, you can start the blockchain node by running:

./prunet_node

This will initialize a new node that connects to other peers, participates in consensus, and begins processing transactions.
Usage
1. Creating a Wallet

To create a wallet and generate a new address, run:

./prunet_wallet create

2. Sending Transactions

To send a transaction from one wallet to another:

./prunet_wallet send --from <sender_address> --to <recipient_address> --amount <amount>

3. Transaction Proof Generation

On the wallet side, SNARK proofs for each transaction are generated automatically using the Halo2 circuit or KZG10 polynomial commitments. These proofs are then sent along with the transaction to the consensus nodes for verification.
Consensus and Block Validation

The consensus mechanism works as follows:

    Leader Election: Nodes are selected based on timetokens (a form of reputation), with the node having the highest reputation becoming the leader of the consensus round.
    Transaction Validation: Each transaction is validated through zero-knowledge proofs (SNARKs) to ensure privacy and correctness. These proofs are generated by the client wallet and validated by the consensus nodes.
    Block Creation: A block is formed once a leader node assembles validated transactions and adds it to the blockchain.
    Blockchain Pruning: The blockchain is kept at a fixed size by periodically compressing old data using Compcrypt and discarding irrelevant blocks while ensuring the integrity and verifiability of the entire chain.

Testing & Simulation

The protocol includes a testing framework to simulate network conditions, consensus rounds, and transaction processing:

    Unit tests for blockchain operations, consensus logic, and SNARK verification.
    Network simulation to test gossip protocol and peer-to-peer communication.
    Stress testing for maximum transactions per second (TPS) and blockchain throughput.

To run tests, use:

./run_tests
